# SYSTEM OVERVIEW

## PROBLEM STATEMENT
Disabilities is an umbrella term, covering impairments, activity limitations, and participation restrictions. An impairment is a problem in body function or structure, An activity limitation is a difficulty encountered by an individual in executing a task or action, and A participation restriction is a problem experienced by an individual in involvement in life situations. As per Census 2011, in India, out of the total population of 121 crores, about 2.68 Cr persons are ‘Disabled’ (2.21%of the total population) Out of 2.68 crores, 1.5 crores are males and 1.18 crore are females Majority (69%) of the disabled population resided in rural areas.
People with disabilities often face various challenges in their day-to-day lives, hindering their ability to perform routine tasks independently and limiting their overall quality of life. It is crucial to explore innovative solutions that leverage the power of the Internet of Things (IoT) to address these challenges and empower individuals with disabilities. The goal of this project is to develop an IoT-based system that can provide assistance, accessibility, and convenience for people with disabilities, enabling them to navigate their environment, communicate effectively, and perform daily activities more efficiently.

## SYSTEM OUTLINE
The Internet of Things (IoT) has the potential to transform the lives of persons with disabilities, our societies, and industries. Today’s IoT devices and services are increasingly accessible to persons with disabilities; some IoT technologies are specifically designed for persons with disabilities, and others are repurposed by persons with disabilities (see figure below). The IoT and its associated data collection are producing accessibility-related advances, ranging from smart home devices to self-driving cars. IoT-based services are also empowering persons with disabilities to participate more fully and autonomously in everyday life by reducing some needs for human intermediaries or accommodations. Data derived from persons with disabilities use of IoT devices and services can provide insights into the challenges or opportunities experienced by persons with disabilities while using IoT devices. These insights can be used to enhance existing IoT products or develop new ones.
Despite the potential benefits of IoT devices and services for persons with disabilities, unique privacy risks and challenges can be raised by the collection, use, and sharing of data about users. Depending on the circumstances, privacy can be enhanced or diminished by technologies, creating tension between privacy gains and losses.
How people balance those tensions depends upon context—including how the service or device is used, who is using it, and individuals’ preferences and values. Some members of the disability community may consider benefits and privacy risks differently than other communities. This consideration—evaluating the ways IoT devices and services allow persons with disabilities to enhance their privacy vs. creating privacy risks via data collection—deserves more nuanced consideration and engagement

## PROPOSED METHODOLOGY
 Amazon Echo and Google Home have been one of the most publicized uses of IoT in people’s homes. To use utilities and basic services within a house, people have to no longer depend on switches and conventional physical methods of interaction. For example, IoT devices allow a visually impaired user to change the heat settings without needing to program a controller. These devices work by using a voice recognition system, without any kind of special setup. For people suffering from paralysis or those who are completely bedridden, such technologies are no less than a boon as they perform functions like unlocking a door without In most cases, people with disabilities require constant monitoring which can often be challenging and demanding for them. Michael J Fox Foundation uses IoT devices to monitor hundreds of people with disabilities and long-term illnesses. They gather millions of diverse data points that hold a clue to cure a disease. The data collected is so enormous that it can be used not only for those who are ill and challenged but also to evolve newer models for developing preventive measures for any new kind of disease as well. IoT will break the accessibility barriers. IoT-enabled smart environments will create an enabling system that embodies inclusiveness, a smart ecosystem that helps challenged people to live their lives freely.
In this project we use the NodeMCU, it is a development board that is a powerful solution to program microcontrollers and be part of the Internet of Things (IoT). The NodeMCU development board, based on ESP8266EX, is a cute module with a microcontroller, integrated Wi-Fi receiver, and transmitter. NodeMCU supports several programming languages; hence, it is very easy to upload programs from any computer over a micro-USB port. I have been playing with the NodeMCU for quite a while now and, I have to say, it is a lot more fun than the other available IoT modules. When it comes to prototyping — just another perfect, relatively cheap, easy-to-learn, and user-friendly minuscule magic module.
Amazon Alexa  Automation, in general, is a big victory for the regular consumer in terms of convenience. However, it brings a much bigger convenience and independence factor to people with disabilities, especially anyone who is blind, in a wheelchair, paraplegic, bedridden because of a spinal cord injury, or doesn’t have good motor skills. It saves them a lot of time and energy by not making them interact with other devices that they may not have skills for or are unable to use because of various disabilities. The only device they interact with is Echo, through voice, and it provides them with the results and information they are looking for instantly, and thus, saves them a lot of trouble. A person in a wheelchair doesn’t have to try to reach a light switch that’s in an awkward corner of a room, a person with not good motor skills doesn’t have to flip through pages or operate an e-reader to read their books, and a blind person doesn’t need to navigate a website on an electronic device to order a pizza anymore. Automation through the Internet of Things doesn’t only have to be at home. A device like Alexa can be installed by an employer at work as well so that employees with disabilities can be more comfortable in their work environments. A device like Echo is not expensive, and it just makes the ability to provide accommodations an inherent part of the system, and not an afterthought.
This is just the beginning though. The kind of features Amazon keeps adding to Echo is mind-boggling, and very exciting to say the least.
We connect security needs with Alexa’s help of Internet of Things security solutions, so building managers and operators can monitor and secure their facilities more effectively. Security surveillance systems and intelligent CCTV systems have improved visibility for organisations and businesses to safeguard their assets, buildings and workers. A smart camera solution can now detect and interpret incidents autonomously.  Robustly has the perfect solution to get your CCTV devices connected. Our 3G/4G routers provide secure and remote access to your CCTV network and are customisable to suit your exact needs.  It’s common to find a connected IoT camera in nearly every smart application, from doorbells and elevators to building management systems. Operating within a network of motion sensors, smoke detectors, and alarms, smart CCTV cameras can alert an operator to an incident and even act autonomously to request help from emergency responders. Smart security systems are in high demand across a range of spaces, including commercial buildings, factories, warehouses and public transport, and are being leveraged in various ways

## HARDWARE IMPLEMENTATION
The hardware utilized in IoT systems includes devices for a remote dashboard, devices for control, servers, a routing or bridge device, and sensors.

### STANDARD DEVICES
The desktop, tablet, and cell phone remain integral parts of IoT as the command centre and remotes. The desktop provides the user with the highest level of control over the system and its settings. The tablet provides access to the key features of the system in a way resembling the desktop and also acts as a remote. The cell phone allows some essential settings modification and also provides remote functionality. Other key connected devices include standard network devices like routers and switches.
## INTERNET OF THINGS - SOFTWARE
IoT software addresses its key areas of networking and action through platforms, embedded systems, partner systems, and middleware. These individual and master applications are responsible for data collection, device integration, real-time analytics, and application and process extension within the IoT network. They exploit integration with critical business systems (e.g., ordering systems, robotics, scheduling, and more) in the execution of related tasks. 
### DATA COLLECTION
 This software manages sensing, measurements, light data filtering, light data security, and aggregation of data. It uses certain protocols to aid sensors in connecting with real-time, machine-to-machine networks. Then it collects data from multiple devices and distributes it by settings. It also works in reverse by distributing data over devices. The system eventually transmits all collected data to a central server.
### DEVICE INTEGRATION
Software-supporting integration binds (dependent relationships) all system devices to create the body of the IoT system. It ensures the necessary cooperation and stable networking between devices. These applications are the defining software technology of the IoT network because, without them, it is not an IoT system. They manage the various applications, protocols, and limitations of each device to allow communication.
### REAL-TIME ANALYTICS
These applications take data or input from various devices and convert it into viable actions or clear patterns for human analysis. They analyze information based on various settings and designs to perform automation-related tasks or provide the data required by the industry.
### APPLICATION AND PROCESS EXTENSION
These applications extend the reach of existing systems and software to allow a wider, more effective system. They integrate predefined devices for specific purposes such as allowing certain mobile devices or engineering instruments access. It supports improved productivity and more accurate data collection.
## INTERNET OF THINGS - TECHNOLOGY AND PROTOCOLS
IoT primarily exploits standard protocols and networking technologies. However, the major enabling technologies and protocols of IoT are RFID, NFC, low-energy Bluetooth, low-energy wireless, low-energy radio protocols, LTE-A, and WiFi-Direct. These technologies support the specific networking functionality needed in an IoT system in contrast to a standard uniform network of common systems.
### NFC AND RFID
RFID (radio-frequency identification) and NFC (near-field communication) provide simple, low-energy, and versatile options for identity and access tokens, connection bootstrapping, and payments.RFID technology employs 2-way radio transmitter-receivers to identify and track tags associated with objects. NFC consists of communication protocols for electronic devices, typically mobile devices and standard devices.
### LOW-ENERGY BLUETOOTH
This technology supports the low-power, long-use need of IoT function while exploiting a standard technology with native support across systems.
### LOW-ENERGY WIRELESS
This technology replaces the most power-hungry aspect of an IoT system. Though sensors and other elements can power down over long periods, communication links (i.e., wireless) must remain in listening mode. Low-energy wireless not only reduces consumption but also extends the life of the device through less use.
### RADIO PROTOCOLS
ZigBee, Z-Wave, and Thread are radio protocols for creating low-rate private area networks. These technologies are low-power but offer high throughput, unlike many similar options. This increases the power of small local device networks without the typical costs.
### LTE-A
LTE-A, or LTE Advanced, delivers an important upgrade to LTE technology by increasing not only its coverage but also reducing its latency and raising its throughput. It gives IoT tremendous power by expanding its range, with its most significant applications being vehicles, UAVs, and similar communication.
### WIFI-DIRECT
Wi-Fi-Direct eliminates the need for an access point. It allows P2P (peer-to-peer) connections with the speed of Wi-Fi, but with lower latency. Wi-Fi-Direct eliminates an element of a network that often bogs it down, and it does not compromise on speed or throughput.
## FEATURE EXTRACTION
This project contains many features for helping disabled people. the basic features are listed below.
### VOICE COMMAND
Alexa is built based on natural language processing (NLP), a procedure of converting speech into words, sounds, and ideas. Amazon records your words. Indeed, interpreting sounds takes up a lot of computational power, the recording of your speech is sent to Amazon’s servers to be analysed more efficiently. Computational power: refers to the speed at that instructions are carried out and is normally expressed in terms of kilo flops, megaflops, etc. Amazon breaks down your “orders” into individual sounds. It then consults a database containing various words’ pronunciations to find which words most closely correspond to the combination of individual sounds. It then identifies important words to make sense of the tasks and carry out corresponding functions. For instance, if Alexa notices words like “sport” or “basketball”, it would open the sports app. Amazon’s servers send the information back to your device and Alexa may speak. If Alexa needs to say anything back, it would go through the same process described above, but in reverse order (source)

The new version comes with the CP2102 serial chip (not CH340) and it works well and without a hassle. However, I noticed that, when it comes to many Chinese online vendors, there’s a blurring mix-up of generation and version names. The common name used by them for version 1.0 is V2, and most of those V2 boards are fabricated by or at least marked with “Amica” Technically, it’s “NodeMCU V1.0 with ESP-12E module

If the motor is powered by a DC power supply then it is called a DC servo motor, and if it is an AC-powered motor then it is called an AC servo motor. For this tutorial, we will be discussing only the DC servo motor working. Apart from these major classifications, there are many other types of servo motors based on the type of gear arrangement and operating characteristics. A servo motor usually comes with a gear arrangement that allows us to get a very high torque servo motor in small and lightweight packages. Due to these features, they are being used in many applications like toy cars, RC helicopters and planes, Robotics, etc.

Understanding the types of valves and how they work can help end users select the right valves for their application’s use.
      
# SYSTEM DESIGN

## DESIGN METHODOLOGY
The Internet of Things design is a special approach to building every part of the IoT architecture. Usual methods to manage, store, and transfer data are not enough to handle the data within the IoT ecosystem (read about that in the article IoT and Big Data). The development approach must be adopted to the peculiarities of the Internet of Things. A single network can count thousands or more connected gadgets, user interfaces in IoT require new design practices, the experience of IoT users differs from the experience of web users, and interactions and contact points between users and IoT systems are unique.
 
## SYSTEM ARCHITECTURE
Internet of Things (IoT) technology has a wide variety of applications and the use of the Internet of Things is growing so faster. Depending upon different application areas of the Internet of Things, it works accordingly as per it has been designed/developed. But it has not a standard defined architecture of working which is strictly followed universally. The architecture of IoT depends upon its functionality and implementation in different sectors. Still, there is a basic process flow based on which IoT is built.
 
###  SENSING LAYER 
Sensors, actuators, and devices are present in this Sensing layer. These Sensors or Actuators accept data(physical/environmental parameters), process data, and emit data over the network.
###  NETWORK LAYER 
Internet/Network gateways and Data Acquisition Systems (DAS) are present in this layer. DAS performs data aggregation and conversion functions Collecting data and aggregating data then converting analogue data of sensors to digital data etc.). Advanced gateways which mainly open up a connection between Sensor networks and the Internet also perform many basic gateway functionalities like malware protection and filtering sometimes decision-making based on inputted data and data management services, etc.
###  DATA PROCESSING LAYER 
This is the processing unit of the IoT ecosystem. Here data is analyzed and pre-processed before sending it to the data centre from where data is accessed by software applications often termed business applications where data is monitored and managed and further actions are also prepared. So here Edge IT or edge analytics comes into the picture.

###  APPLICATION LAYER 
This is the last layer of the 4 stages of IoT architecture. Data centres or cloud is the management stage of data where data is managed and is used by end-user applications like agriculture, health care, aerospace, farming, defence, etc.
## PROPOSED FRAMEWORK
 
Home automation, security, safety, privacy, and energy consumption is an emerging field of technology and can be implemented with different microcontrollers and processors i.e., Desktop PC, laptops, Raspberry Pi, Arduino, etc., All these microcontroller and processors have their pros and cons, but Raspberry Pi is more versatile and efficient option compared to other units. The smart home concepts can have many components including 1) Sensors, 2) Gateways, 3) Protocols, 4) Firmware and 5) Cloud-based databases. The main focus of bringing AI to the smart home is to automate certain processes that need more than thresholds and pre-defined configurations. For example, one such task is fall detection. The process of integrating AI in the smart home is more natural and requires a significant amount of computational overhead. Today, most of the data generated by IoT devices resides outside the scope of the cloud so it is more natural to bring the machine learning capabilities closer to the source of the data and reduce the amount of bandwidth it consumes by transferring the entire dataset for each training session. Therefore, we leverage an approach called mobile edge compcomputinere the collaborative nature of the architecture makes it easy to train data locally on the device, and then send data to the higher-level layers of the DNN to train it on the edge server. The remaining data is relayed to the cloud where the resource-intensive tasks are offloaded and the remaining mode is trained on the cloud d.the architecture derived from federated learning proposed by Konecˇny´ et al. The authors proposed a method called on deon-demand learning co-inference with edge synergy. The authors argue that using the right sizing approach for DNN layers, the early exit point of the layer must be maintained to offload computationally intense tasks to the cloud from the compacomparativeurce constraint devices. We make use of the same technique discussed here and build upon our framework to work with SqueezeNet for fall detection using Jetson Nano as an edgaedgerocessing node. In this architecture, the data acquisition and processing layer acquires data and is processed locally on the Raspberry Pi as it is the main processing device for IoT devices. The Raspberry Pi itself is not capable of training the model as it lacks GPUthe capabilities that Jetson Nano possesses. The Jetson Nano receives the data and trains a preliminary model for text and multimedia data acquired from the surveillance camera. The multimedia data from the surveillance cameras are much larger in size compared to other devices, therefore the data is trained on the edge node, where the deep learning model is trained using Jetson Nano capable of performing certain levels of computation. However, we assume that the number of multimedia devices may grow in the future and the edge device mentioned here may not respond to all data for training. For this purpose, we split the model and lower-level layers are placed on the server, while the rest of the higher-level layers of the DNN are placed on the cloud with presumably an infinite amount of resources. The cloud model can receive weights from the edge server, it can also update parameters sent from the Jetson Nano or it can also be trained by the data directly sent to the cloud by the IoT devices themselves however, the data sent by the devices directly can compromise the acy and may require additional security. The aggregation module of the cloud layer provides means of aggregation for all parameters sent to the cloud and it helps update all the weights of a single model that can send predictions and estimations along with trends to the IoT devices. To deploy AI services through the cloud, we make use of cloud services provided by Amazon, called Amazon Web Services. It provides off-the-shelf technologies to integrate and deploy AI in IoT applications without too many complications. Moreover, it has a built-in dashboard to support Jetson Nano and is compatible with most IoT applications in general. Details of the working of the edge device and device-based learning for the IoT devices are presented in Fig. 3. The edge layer is equipped with a slightly more powerful device Jetson Nano that acts as a Fog Node and performs machine learning tasks for text and multimedia data. The device receives data and sends it to a feature extraction model. Then the features are sent to train the model itself, where they can be assessed for offloading the cloud or evaluated for training accuracy. The final predictions are sent back to the device and thereafter to the cloud for storage and updating of the cloud-based learning model. The cloud sends updated parameters to the Raspberry Pi which controls and overlooks the connected IoT devices. In this case, the Raspberry Pi changes the values of certain IoT devices like temperature sensors, and surveillance cameras to change parameters. For instance, the temperature sensor can raise the threshold based on the values sent by the cloud model for the next day. In the case of water management, the estimation module can predict the water requirements for the day based on values estimated by the model on previous days of the week. The estimation module uses a REST API and MQTT protocol to connect to the devices and updates the relevant sensor with appropriate results received from the model. 


# PROJECT PANNING

## PROTEUS DESIGN SUITE 
 The Proteus Design Suite is a proprietary software tool suite used primarily for electronic design automation. The software is used mainly by electronic design engineers and technicians to create schematics and electronic prints for manufacturing printed circuit boards. We used this suit to make a schematic and test our schematic virtually. 
## AURDINO COMPILER
The Arduino IDE brings its own GCC compiler. It is a version, that can compile for the AVR platform (don't know, if the standard version is capable of that). When we activate verbose output for compilation in the preferences of your Arduino IDE, we can see, what calls to GCC the IDE is doing. The Arduino development software performs some minor pre-processing to turn your sketch into a C++ program. Next, the dependencies of the sketch are located. It then gets passed to a compiler (avr-gcc), which turns the human-readable code into machine-readable instructions (or object files) Arduino uses a variant of the C++ programming language. The code is written in C++ with an addition of special methods and functions. However, it's possible to use Arduino with Python or another high-level programming language. Platforms like Arduino work well with Python, especially for applications that require integration with sensors and other physical devices.





# IMPLEMENTATION AND TESTING

##	SETTING UP ARDUINO IDE
Install the ESP8266 board in Arduino IDE, following these next instructions: In your Arduino IDE, go to File> PreferencesEnter http://arduino.esp8266.com/stable/package_esp8266com_index.json into the “Additional Boards Manager URLs” field as shown in the figure below. Then, click the “OK” button: Note: if already have the ESP32 boards URL, can separate the URLs with a comma Open the Boards Manager. Go to Tools > Board > Boards Manager…Search for ESP8266 and press the install button for the “ESP8266 by ESP8266 Community”: That’s it. It should be installed after a few seconds.
## SETTING UP PCB
1.	Turn the soldering iron on and let it warm up for a few minutes. Wet the sponge with a few ounces of clean water. When the soldering iron is hot, clean the tip on the sponge, then tin the tip by melting a small amount of fresh solder on it.
2.	Look at the schematic and the circuit board's component side. Identify how to orient all the parts. Transistors, ICs and other components need to be placed correctly. Begin by inserting sockets for any ICs, cables, and other parts that need them. Put the sockets on the component side. To keep them from slipping out, you can bend a couple of pins over slightly on the trace side of the board.
3.	Touch the soldering iron tip to the leads protruding through the pad holes for a few seconds. This is on the board’s trace side. Let enough solder melt on the joint to cover it and form a smooth, shiny joint. Try not to dwell on the joint with the iron for more than about ten seconds. Solder each lead to its corresponding pad, then move on to the next socket. Let the solder cool for a minute. If any leads protrude from the solder pad longer than a couple of millimetres, clip them off with the diagonal cutters.
4.	Insert a few resistors and capacitors into the board. Check the orientation of any polarized capacitors. Resistor leads are usually bent at a 90-degree angle with the part, so the leads can slip through the board. Capacitor leads may be bent or go through straight, depending on the part. Solder each lead as in Step 3. Clip off excess leads after soldering. Continue to insert, orient, solder, and clip parts until all of them are done.
5.	Prepare stranded wire, if any is required, by twisting the bare copper strands tightly. Heat the wire for a few seconds and let a thin coat of solder melt in. Insert and solder wire into the board as required. As above, clip off the excess. The wire may be for power, signals, or testing. For short jumpers, you can use clipped excess leads from Step 4.
6.	Insert ICs and other parts into their sockets, checking their orientation. This completes the board's assembly.
 
## PROGRAMMING THE MICROCONTROLLER
